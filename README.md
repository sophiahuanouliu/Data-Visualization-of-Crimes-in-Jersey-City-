# Data-Visualization-of-Crimes-in-Jersey-City-
I was inspired by the project by tejaykodali on Github. The link is https://github.com/tejaykodali/Chicago-mvt-data and the topic is to visualize the crimes of Chicago as heatmap. And I plan to do the simliar project for Jersey City which is the palce I live.
